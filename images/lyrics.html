            [Hook]
            —Girl Scout, thin mints in a Russian Cream
            Hysteric Glamour hoodie, BAPE shoes and Evisu jeans
            Bad foreign bitch, hair pink just like Sakura
            Gold caps on my third eye glow just like Amun-Ra
            Lil' bro put a sword on a chop just like Zabuza
            Put titties on a GLOCK, let 'em flash just like Mardi Gras
            And this—

            [Intro]
            (SURF GANG)
            Hi-C, bitch
            (EVILGIANE)
            Go, go (Go, go)
            Hi-C, man
            Go, go (Go, go, Bloodbath!)
            Hi-C Touchdown
            Aight, fuck it, let's go
            Let's get it

            [Verse]
            Hi-C, PunchGang, let my nuts hang
            Nigga cop a book of LSD and flip the whole page
            All these different flavors in the 'Wood, smokin' dope strains
            Lil' bro the plug down in Cali, now he grow strains
            Neck on chiller, wrists cold like an ice age (Hello, hello)
            Cartiers protect me from the glare like a lampshade
            Pussy ass nigga talkin' crazy from a fake page
            Keep speakin' on me, all that hate just give me more fame
            Broke ass nigga, you don't even got a band saved
            Niggas broke and they starved, I can see these niggas' ribcage
            Actin' friendly, I'm like, "Hell nah, you can't get no handshake"
            Tried to stab me in my back, nigga, two can play at that game
            Had my bro stomp a pussy nigga flat like a pancake
            I was broke, but them racks patch me up, call 'em BAND-AIDs
            Louis V checkerboard on my belt, like a chess game
            BAPE shoes, BAPE hoodie, black and white, like a yin yang
            Pull up, V12 Scat Pack colored orange tang
            Hi-Tech got my goons in this fashion, drippin' blood stains
            Thigh pads in my jeans, pockets filled up with [?]
            Got a bad foreign bitch, eat the dick like its gourmet
            Pull up, twin GLOCKs on my hip, call 'em twin flames
            Glow two-door, ride past, watch 'em shift shape
            Nobu, Fogos, eating lamb steak
            Vivienne chain, and the stones pink lemonade
            Righthanded snake, cut him off, Xavier Renegade
            Right hand of God, you get left if you in the way
            I know that she yours, I'ma still fuck her anyway
            We got commas, told her call me Hi-C the great (SURF GANG, EVILGIANE)
            I can't let these pussy niggas get next to me
            Chrome Heart tee, with the Vivienne accessories
            Bitch eatin' dick, and her friend was an accessory
            Probably broke every lil' nigga heart that's instead of me
            Give that boy a head start, how you still not ahead of me?
            You my son, you my kid, better not bite the hand that feed
            I feel like a Girl Scout, thin mints in a Russian Cream
            Hysteric Glamour hoodie, BAPE shoes and Evisu jeans
            Bad foreign bitch, hair pink just like Sakura
            Gold caps on my third eye glow just like Amun-Ra
            Lil' bro put a sword on a chop' just like Zabuza
            Put titties on a Glock, let 'em flash just like Mardi Gras
            And this ain't yoga class, but your bitch in a downward dog
            On that Hi-Tech splash, pour a deuce, got me noddin' off
            All these lil' Twitter niggas on dick, need to knock it off
            Punch a pussy ass nigga in his head 'til I knock it off
            
            [Outro]
            Yeah, that shit man
            Hi-C Touchdown in this bitch, man (Straight bars, nigga)
            Lil' freeverse, man (Hello, hello)
            Niggas wanted me to go back to my old style, man (Hello)
            Shit, man, how the fuck I'm gon' do that, man? all these lil' niggas done bit that shit up, bro (No cap, man, [?])
            Fuck it though, man, Hi-C Touchdown, bitch
            (Hi-C, Hi-C, Hi-C, yeah, bitch)
